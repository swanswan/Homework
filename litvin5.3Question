Reserved words are words that have designated functions and can't be used by the programmer to do/be arbitrary things. They are important to programs because they can only be used in a predetermined way. Syntax is important because syntax errors confuse the computer and your program will not work in the expected way/not work period. Style is also important because your program may be fine syntactically and understandable to the computer but it may not be readable to other programmers who are trying to edit/update/use your code.
