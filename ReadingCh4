What was confusing:

It’s said that “some people never completely come to grips” with recursion… 
It seems very similar to proof by induction, which I never fully understood.
I can’t understand why this method would ever be used when it has to repeat the task every time n increases by 1, just like an iterative function. 
I also don’t understand how to use lists in a program other than “finding” one of the numbers in the list. 
Can lists only have numbers?
