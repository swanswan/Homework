8. count += (total/pages -5) * words -1 ;

9. Change System.out.println(1/2*(g*t*t)); to System.out.println(0.5*(g*t*t));
The code is read left to right, so 1/2 is calculated as 0, and the answer is a double 0.0.
1/2 and 0.5 are the same but 0.5 is a double, so with 0.5, the expected result is produced.

12. (double) temp = a;
b= (double) temp;
